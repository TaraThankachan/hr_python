##Write a ‘Python’ program to accept list of elements and key element from user and perform linear search, print element found along with its position or element Not found.

x= list(map(int,input('Enter the list:\n').split()))
k= int(input('Enter Key:\n'))
for i in range(0,len(x)):
    if x[i]==k:
        print(f'Element {k} FOUND at position {i+1}')
        break
else:
    print(f'Element {k} NOT FOUND')
